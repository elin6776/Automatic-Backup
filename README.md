# Automated Backup and Restore System

This Python desktop application provides a user-friendly graphical interface to select multiple source folders and a backup destination folder. It performs local backups by detecting changes in each source folder and creating timestamped backups. Optionally, it can upload these backups to Google Drive. The app displays backup status and logs the last backup time.
